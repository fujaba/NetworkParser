# Networkparser - Information about our contribution rules and coding style

Anyone is welcome to contribute to Networkparser. You can either take up
tasks from our [Issue list](https://github.com/fujaba/NetworkParser/issues),

to defend and justify your enhancements, and get through few rounds
of changes.
