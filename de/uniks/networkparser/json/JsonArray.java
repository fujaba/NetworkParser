/**
 * A JSONArray is an ordered sequence of values. Its external text form is a
 * string wrapped in square brackets with commas separating the values. The
 * internal form is an object having <code>get</code> and <code>opt</code>
 * methods for accessing the values by index, and <code>put</code> methods for
 * adding or replacing values. The values can be any of these types:
 * <code>Boolean</code>, <code>JSONArray</code>, <code>JSONObject</code>,
 * <code>Number</code>, <code>String</code>, or the
 * <code>JSONObject.NULL object</code>.
 * <p>
 * The constructor can convert a JSON text into a Java object. The
 * <code>toString</code> method converts to JSON text.
 * <p>
 * A <code>get</code> method returns a value if one can be found, and throws an
 * exception if one cannot be found. An <code>opt</code> method returns a
 * default value instead of throwing an exception, and so is useful for
 * obtaining optional values.
 * <p>
 * The generic <code>get()</code> and <code>opt()</code> methods return an
 * object which you can cast or query for type. There are also typed
 * <code>get</code> and <code>opt</code> methods that do type checking and type
 * coercion for you.
 * <p>
 * The texts produced by the <code>toString</code> methods strictly conform to
 * JSON syntax rules. The constructors are more forgiving in the texts they will
 * accept:
 * <ul>
 * <li>An extra <code>,</code>&nbsp;<small>(comma)</small> may appear just
 * before the closing bracket.</li>
 * <li>The <code>null</code> value will be inserted when there is <code>,</code>
 * &nbsp;<small>(comma)</small> elision.</li>
 * <li>Strings may be quoted with <code>'</code>&nbsp;<small>(single
 * quote)</small>.</li>
 * <li>Strings do not need to be quoted at all if they do not begin with a quote
 * or single quote, and if they do not contain leading or trailing spaces, and
 * if they do not contain any of these characters:

 * <code>{ } [ ] / \ : , = ; #</code> and if they do not look like numbers and
