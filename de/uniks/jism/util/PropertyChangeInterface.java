/*
The FUJABA ToolSuite project

  FUJABA is the acronym for 'From Uml to Java And Back Again'
  and originally aims to provide an environment for round-trip
  engineering using UML as visual programming language. During
  the last years, the environment has become a base for several
  research activities, e.g. distributed software, database
  systems, modelling mechanical and electrical systems and
  their simulation. Thus, the environment has become a project,
  where this source code is part of. Further details are avail-
  able via http://www.fujaba.de
